# Auto Corrector

A small implementation of the "Did you mean: ...." feature of the Google search using a 3 layered (1 hidden layer) neural network.

To run this script, download this project, set Octave to point to the 'Core' folder from this repository,
in the Octave command window, type **Start** and press the enter key to run the scripts.

No Machine Learning or Neural Network libraries have been used for this project because I intended to gain a deeper understanding of Neural Networks with this project. I do plan to push another, **optimized** version which, hopefully, would come out as a complete product.
